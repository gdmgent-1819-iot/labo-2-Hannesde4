# Tinder @ raspberry pi
### Made by Hannes De Baere
#### Made for Arteveldehogeschool for "internet of things"


Greetings human

The basic functionality is tinder with implementation of the led matrix and joystick from the sense hat with implementation of a random people generator API

When you start you get a welcome message, than you can press the joystick to start the tinder application, go up to see the all the liked persons, go down to see al the disliked persons

When the main application runs the current person loops, untill you go left for dislike, right for like (with the joystick), if you press the middle button of the joystick you go back to the beginning.

Enjoy my application!
Thanks for reading!
